  "model": "sonnet"
}
```

### Advanced Database Operations
```javascript
{
  "operation": "query",
  "prompt": "Create an optimized query to find users who haven't logged in for 30 days",
  "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
  "model": "opus"
}
```

### Customer Support Automation
```javascript
{
  "operation": "query",
  "prompt": "Customer reports: 'Login button not working on mobile devices'\n\nAnalyze this issue, find the root cause, and create a fix",
  "projectPath": "/path/to/web-app",
  "model": "opus",
  "allowedTools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep"],
